# To-Do List Application (Console-Based)

This is a simple console-based To-Do List application built in Java that interacts with a MySQL database. The application allows users to add tasks, view tasks, and mark tasks as completed.

## Features
- **Add Task**: Add a new task to the list.
- **View Tasks**: Display all tasks, including completed and incomplete ones.
- **Mark Task as Completed**: Mark a specific task as completed by its ID.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are stored in a MySQL database for future retrieval.

## Requirements
- **Java 8 or above**
- **MySQL** with JDBC driver
- **MySQL Database** and a table named `tasks`
- **JDBC Driver**: Make sure the MySQL JDBC connector (`mysql-connector-java-X.X.X.jar`) is included in the project.

## MySQL Setup

1. Start your MySQL server.
2. Create a database and a table for storing tasks:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE to_do_list_db;

USE to_do_list_db;

CREATE TABLE tasks (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    is_completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);
```

## Project Structure

```
src/
  ├── ToDoList.java      // Contains the logic for adding, showing, and completing tasks.
  └── Task.java          // Represents the task object with id, title, and completion status.
```

### `ToDoList.java`
- Contains methods to interact with the MySQL database:
  - **`addTask(String title)`**: Adds a task to the database.
  - **`markTaskAsCompleted(int id)`**: Marks a task as completed based on its ID.
  - **`getAllTasks()`**: Fetches all tasks from the database.

### `Task.java`
- Represents each task with the following attributes:
  - `id`: The unique identifier for the task.
  - `title`: The task description.
  - `isCompleted`: A boolean indicating if the task is completed.

## How to Run

1. **Download or clone the project** to your local machine.
2. **Configure MySQL Connection**:
   - Open `ToDoList.java`.
   - Update the MySQL connection details:
     ```java
     String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/to_do_list_db";
     String username = "root"; // Replace with your MySQL username
     String password = "password"; // Replace with your MySQL password
     ```
3. **Compile and Run the Application**:
   - Compile:
     ```bash
     javac -cp "lib/mysql-connector-java-X.X.X.jar" src/ToDoList.java src/Task.java
     ```
   - Run:
     ```bash
     java -cp ".:lib/mysql-connector-java-X.X.X.jar" ToDoList
     ```
4. **Use the Application**:
   - Add tasks and manage your to-do list from the console.

## Example

### Adding a Task
```
Enter new task: 
> Finish the Java project
Task added successfully.
```

### Viewing Tasks
```
1. [ ] Finish the Java project
```

### Marking a Task as Completed
```
Enter the task ID to mark as completed: 
> 1
Task marked as completed successfully.
```

### Viewing Completed Tasks
```
1. [x] Finish the Java project
```

## Troubleshooting
- **SQLSyntaxErrorException**: Make sure the `tasks` table exists in the database and the connection details are correct.
- **MySQL Connection Issues**: Ensure MySQL server is running and you've provided the correct username, password, and database URL in `ToDoList.java`.
